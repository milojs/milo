    <!-- Milo is messenger crazy, everything has a messenger, components, 
         their facets, models, and even milo itself (milo.mail).
         So it's obviously important that we get a handle on them. -->

    <!-- Most of the tutorial will be in JavaScript, but lets setup two component
         so we can explore messenger with components and facets. -->

    //JS

        milo(function() {
            var mail = milo.mail
                , scope = milo.binder()
                , comp = scope.comp
                , input = scope.input;
            // The easiest way to get to know messenger is to take a look at milo's
            // global messenger, milo.mail. The milo.mail messenger uses the window
            // to give us a wrapper for the native 'window.postMessage', but can also
            // pass any custom messages, so let's have a look at that.
            
            // Messenger has methods for managing listeners, on and off are for 
            // adding and removing single subscribers.
            mail.on('mymessage', example1);
            mail.off('mymessage', example1);
            
            // You can also put multiple messages in a string, or an array
            mail.on('msg1 msg2 msg3', example1);
            
            // We also have onMessages, and offMessages for multiple subscribers.
            mail.onMessages({
                'message1': example1,
                'message2': example2,
                'message3': example1
            });
            mail.offMessages({
                'message1': example1,
                'message2': example2
            });
            
            // We can also pass a regular expression, instead of a string, as
            // the message.
            milo.mail.on(/.*/, example3);
            
            // We can get all the subscribers for any given message using getSubscribers.
            // Notice the only one left for 'message1' is the regex 'catch-all'.
            console.log('LOG 1: ', mail.getSubscribers('message1'));
            
            // If you look at the logs, we still have one subscriber registered.
            // Lets trigger that using the messenger postMessage method.
            mail.postMessage('message1');
            
            // We can pass any data we like along with the message.
            mail.postMessage('message1', {name: 'Jason', age: 30});
            
            // We also have a method for turning off all messages.
            mail.offAll();

            // More importantly, we have messengers on components and their facets.
            // Component messengers work much the same as milo.mail, but with the
            // context set as the component itself
            comp.on('begin', function(msg, data) { console.log('LOG 3: ', this) });
            comp.postMessage('begin');
            
            // More interesting is that our facets have their own messengers, which
            // have been customised for their purpose. Events facet is for DOM events,
            // and the data facet understands when the dom data changes.
            comp.events.on('click mouseover', function(type, event) {
                // In this case our arguments are the event type string, and the
                // native event object. The context is the facet, but we can get back
                // to the component using the owner property.
                console.log('LOG 4: ', this.owner);
                console.log('LOG 5: ', event.clientX, event.clientY);
            });
            
            // Don't want to have the facet as the context, well we can pass any
            // context we like, using an object literal with subscriber and context
            comp.events.on('mouseup', {subscriber: example1, context: comp});
            
            // When it comes to creating custom component classes, there is a bit 
            // more to learn about messenger context, but we'll learn about that in 
            // a later lesson.
            
            // Let's listen to data changed on our input component. By passing
            // an empty string as the message, we are listening to changes on
            // the root level of our component, the scalar value of the input.
            input.data.on('', function(msg, data) {
                // Notice now that when you type in the input field, this event
                // fires. The data object passed with the message is tailored
                // for the data facet, and has oldValue, newValue as well as
                // the type of operation, in this case, 'changed'
                console.log('LOG 6: ', data);
            });
            
            // Well that's all for messengers, it is possible to create your
            // own types of messengers by defining a messenger source, and a
            // messenger api, but that is a more advanced lesson.
        });

        function example2() {}
        function example3(msg, data) { console.log('LOG 2: ', msg, data); }
