    <!-- Let's take a look at the basics of binding. A lot of what you see
         will be covered in more detail in later tutorials. -->

    <!-- You can bind a component to an element with ml-bind attribute.
         The value is in the format of "ComponentClass:componentName".
         Below is the most simple binding and binds to an instance of the
         base Component class.-->
    <div ml-bind="Component:myComp">My first component</div>

    <!-- The base Component class is default, so you can bind like this too -->
    <div ml-bind=":myComp2">The same component class</div>

    <!-- Milo takes an aspect-oriented approach to inheritance by putting         
         functionality into "facets" and attaching them to components.
         You can make your own facets, but there are many provided by milo.
         You can use facets to configure custom classes, or put them right
         into the ml-bind attribute. -->
    <div ml-bind="[dom events]:facetComp">A component with facets</div>

    <!-- When you configure a custom class, binding it to an element is as
         simple as this. We'll create that class in the js below. -->
    <div ml-bind="MyCompClass:customComp">A custom component</div>

<!-- END HTML -->

        // So lets bind these components.
        // This function call makes sure milo and the dom are ready
        milo(function() {
            
            // First we need to bind our components. We'll call binder and get
            // a scope object containing the tree of components.
            var scope = milo.binder();
            
            // We can access our first component as a property of the scope object
            var myComp = scope.myComp;
            
            // All components have some base functionality.
            // - They have methods for managing their facets.
            // - They have methods for traversing up and down the scope tree.
            // - They have methods for getting and setting their state which
            //   includes the state of all facets and child components.
            // - They each have a messenger.
            // - And of course they each have a reference to their element.
            myComp.el.innerHTML = 'Modified element.';
            
            // Facet functionality can be accessed through the facet name
            // as a property. Facets have access to the component, and it's element.
            // Facets can also access other facets, and call their methods.
            var facetComp = scope.facetComp;
            
            // We can access the dom facet to add a css class
            facetComp.dom.addCssClasses('highlight');
            
            // Or set some styles
            facetComp.dom.setStyles({
                'position': 'relative',
                'left': '10px'
            });
            
            // The events facet gives us a convenient method of subscribing to
            // regular dom events.
            facetComp.events.on('click', function(type, event) {
                alert('Clicked');
            });
            
            // Our custom component works the same way, but it can have 
            // preconfigured and custom functionality. Let's call the render 
            // method of the template facet of our custom component
            var customComp = scope.customComp;

            // Notice we didn't pass a template, that's because it has been
            // setup in the class configuration.
            customComp.template.render({type: 'awesome'});
        });

        // Now lets look create a component class. We can give it two facets,
        // dom and template, and preconfigure them to suit our needs. 
        var MyCompClass = milo.Component.createComponentClass('MyCompClass', {
            // dom facet config allows us to preconfigure a css class
            dom: {cls: 'big-text'},
            // template facet config allows us to provide a template string
            template: { template: 'A custom {{=it.type}} component' }
        });

        // All that's left is to add the class to the milo registry.
        milo.registry.components.add(MyCompClass);
